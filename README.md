# House_Price_Prediction_Model
Built a linear regression model to predict the price of house using two features- Size of House and total number of rooms.

The file predict_price.py contains the model for 2 features and ex1data2 is the datset file.

I used both gradient Descent method and Normal equation to find the appropriate hypothesis.
